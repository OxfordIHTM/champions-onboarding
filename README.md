The [Oxford iHealth Champions Programme](https://oxford-ihtm.io/champions/) aims to champion and support our community members in their journey towards the practice of open and reproducible science. In turn, our members become champions - advocates of open and reproducible science in their own contexts.

This repository contains literate code for developing and producing the slide deck used for the Oxford iHealth Champions onboarding sessions.
