The [Oxford iHealth Champions Programme](https://oxford-ihtm.io/champions/) aims to champion and support our community members in their journey towards the practice of open and reproducible science. In turn, our members become champions - advocates of open and reproducible science in their own contexts.

This repository contains literate code for developing, producing, and deploying the slide deck used for the Oxford iHealth Champions onboarding sessions.
